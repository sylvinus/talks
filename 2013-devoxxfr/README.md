## Description

A live-coding introduction to Backbone.js. The goal was to give a quick introduction to Backbone and show people simply why and how to use it. The demo app featured face detection of "Kitlers" (cats that look like Hitler). The code was first live-coded at ParisJS #18, then updated for this session at Devoxx FR with Yeoman & RequireJS.
