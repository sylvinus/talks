# Javascript Views, Client-side or Server-side with NodeJS

- **Event:** Paris Node Meetup
- **Date:** June 8, 2011
- **Location:** Paris, France

## Description

Exploring the use of Javascript views that can render both client-side in the browser and server-side with Node.js ("One common app core, two adapters: Node.js & Browsers"). Benefits included a single codebase, serving HTML-only versions for crawlers and odd devices, and the View Class design with `render()`, `enhance()`, and `transitionTo()`. This was a precursor to the Joshfire Framework release on June 29. Presented in front of Node.js creator Ryan Dahl.
